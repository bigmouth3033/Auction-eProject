		<h3><strong>There are over 35 self-portraits by Vincent but just one portrait photo of him</strong></h3>
		<p>
			Only one portrait photo of Vincent has survived. It shows him at the age of 19 with a slightly gruff expression. Almost everything
			else we know about his appearance comes from the many self-portraits he painted.
		</p>
		<p>
			No fewer than 35 of them are known. They tell us that he had red hair, green eyes and an angular face. Yet each of those faces is
			different. Vincent himself wrote:
		</p>
		<p>
			<em
				>‘People say – and I’m quite willing to believe it – that it’s difficult to know oneself – but it’s not easy to paint oneself
				either.’</em
			>
		</p>

		<h3><strong>Vincent didn’t paint self-portraits because he was vain</strong></h3>
		<p>Vincent produced his self-portraits because he wanted to practise painting people.</p>
		<p>
			The majority of them – over 25 – were done while he was in Paris (1886–88). He was short of money in that period and struggled to find
			models. So the artist chose the simplest solution and painted himself.
		</p>
		<p>
			To save money, he sometimes painted self-portraits on the back of other paintings. By doing that, he avoided the costs not only of a
			model but also of expensive canvas. You can see&nbsp;five such self-portraits&nbsp;in the Van Gogh Museum's online collection.
		</p>
		<p>
			In July 2022&nbsp;a hidden self-portrait&nbsp;was discovered in the collection of The National Galleries of Scotland in Edinburgh.
		</p>
		<h3><strong>The self-portraits tell us something about his personality</strong></h3>
		<p>Vincent often presented himself as restrained and serious in his self-portraits, with a look of concentration on his face..</p>
		<p>
			All the same, something of Vincent’s personality can be found in each self-portrait. He described the last one he did in Paris
			as&nbsp;<em>‘quite unkempt and sad’ [...] something like, say, the face of – death’</em>. That’s how he felt at the time: mentally and
			physically exhausted.
