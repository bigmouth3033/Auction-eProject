                    <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>It's easy to sell with AuctionsTable's</strong><strong> – here's how:</strong></h2>
                    <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="img-fluid" src="images/selling-guide-cover-680x425.PNG" alt="contact-us">
                    </p>
                    <ul style="text-align: justify">
                        <li style="list-style-type:decimal;">First, request a complimentary&nbsp;auction estimate, and see if your item is suitable for AuctionsTable's sale<br /></li><br>
                        <li style="list-style-type:decimal;">A AuctionsTable's specialist will contact you to discuss estimates, advise on sale dates and explain your Seller's Agreement and commission structure</li><br>
                        <li style="list-style-type:decimal;">Once you have signed your Seller's Agreement, you should arrange for the item to be delivered to our saleroom or warehouse. Christie's can assist with this, or we can put you in contact with trusted local shippers<br /></li> <br>
                        <li style="list-style-type:decimal;">Our specialists will coordinate every detail, from cataloguing your property to marketing it to prospective buyers worldwide</li><br>
                    </ul>

                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">You will receive a notification informing you of the price that your item achieved at auction. We will then confirm your net proceeds of sale based on the hammer price, with any agreed-upon expenses and commission deducted. Please note that prices listed on our website display the hammer price inclusive of the buye's premium.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">AuctionsTable's will then act on your behalf to secure payment from the buyer. Provided we have received payment in full, approximately 35 days after the auction, your payment will be sent to your nominated account, and you will receive a settlement statement for the sale.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">If a buyer was not found for your item, Christie's will contact you to discuss either re-offering or collecting your property. In some circumstances, we can recommend an alternative auction house.
