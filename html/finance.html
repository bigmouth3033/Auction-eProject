				</h2>
        <div class="text-center"><img src="./images/finance-2.jpg" class="img-fluid my-4" alt=""></div>
				<p>
					<span class="fw-bold">Step 1 : </span>Request a complimentary estimate to see if your items are suitable collateral for a loan by using our
					online auction estimates tool or contacting one of our global specialists.
				</p>
				<ul>

				<p>
					<span class="fw-bold">Step 2 : </span>Our AuctionsTable's Finance team and Specialists will discuss the estimates and terms of the proposed
					financing conditions with you. We will provide you with a preliminary term sheet for your review.
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="fw-bold">Step 3 : </span>Request a complimentary estimate to see if your items are suitable collateral for a loan by using our
					online auction estimates tool or contacting one of our global specialists.
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						The AuctionsTable's Finance team will be your point of contact throughout the transaction in order to guide you on what
						supporting documentation may be needed, such as insurance certificates or KYC documentation. We will also provide you with
						status updates on your loan.
					</li>
					<li>
						You should arrange for the item to be delivered to one of our offices in New York, London, Hong Kong or one of our approved
						warehouses. AuctionsTable's can assist with this or put you in touch with trusted local shippers.
					</li>
					<li>
						Our Specialists will coordinate every detail, ranging from cataloguing the property and confirming condition to completing all
						the required research to underwrite the loan.

				<h2 id="list-item-3" class="my-5 text-danger"><strong>FAQs</strong></h2>
        <div class="text-center"><img src="./images/finance-3.jpg" class="img-fluid my-4" alt=""></div>
				<p class="fw-bold">What does AuctionsTable's Finance do?</p>
				<p>
					Our aim is to meet the liquidity needs of our clients by offering loans greater than $1,000,000 against their fine collection.
					Other types of art collateral will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
				</p>
				<hr />
				<p class="fw-bold">Where does AuctionsTable's provide financing?</p>
				<p>
					Loans will be executed out of New York, London or Hong Kong, and generally to clients located in the US, UK, Switzerland and Hong
					Kong. Clients located in other jurisdictions will be considered on a case-by-case basis, and additional diligence and legal
					analysis will be necessary before proceeding.
				</p>
				<hr />
				<p class="fw-bold">How much can I borrow and for how long?</p>
				<p>
					A typical loan would fall within the region of 40-60% of the low auction estimate of the collateral. These loans are offered for a
					period of 1-3 years, but we can consider more bespoke arrangements based on the circumstances.
				</p>
				<hr />
				<p class="fw-bold">Does AuctionsTable's take possession of the collateral?</p>
				<p>
					Generally, we do. But, in certain jurisdictions, we may allow the pledged art to remain in the client's possession if the legal
					framework allows.
				</p>
				<p>
					In all cases, the responsibility for insurance coverage on the artwork remains with the owner, with AuctionsTable's Financial
					Services named as additional insured party and first loss payee.
				</p>
				<hr />
				<p class="fw-bold">Can I borrow from AuctionsTable's without committing to a sale?</p>
				<p>
					Absolutely. With a loan against your artwork, there is no obligation to sell. At end of the term, the loan may be refinanced or
					repaid. Should you desire, our Specialists can work on a sale plan to raise part or all of the funds due â€” but this is not at all
					required.
				</p>
				<p>
					Additionally, for clients who are considering sales within a shorter term (less than a year), we can provide financing as an
					advance against sale at even more advantageous terms.
				</p>
				<hr />
				<p class="fw-bold">How quickly can I receive funds?</p>
				<p>
					Once initial terms are agreed, we can typically fund within 2-3 weeks. This ability to move more quickly than most financial
					institutions is a function of lending only against the value of the collateral artwork.
				</p>
				<hr />
				<p class="fw-bold">How do I start? What do I need to provide?</p>
				<p">
					Our goal is to partner closely with you in an effort to structure the loan to meet your financial needs and to support the
					objectives around your fine collection. The first step involves meeting with us to discuss what you are looking for and
					providing us with details about the property. Following our initial discussions and once we have received full descriptions of the
					artworks (medium, dimensions, date) as well as any high-resolution images you may have, we can provide an initial appraisal of the
					artwork and indicative terms for the loan.
				</p>
				<p>
					Once terms have been accepted, we will need documents that verify the provenance, ownership and insurance for the art proposed as
					collateral. Also, we will need to complete the required steps or collect additional information for Know Your Client (KYC)
					purposes.
