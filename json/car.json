			"content": "<p>Ford reinvented its 1955 model lineup and did a great deal to define the concept of personal driving by introducing the first of the two-seat Thunderbirds that year. The restoration history of this 1955 Ford Thunderbird Convertible is not stated, but the seller describes it as 'a real barn find' that was discovered under a lean-to in Colorado, and which still reportedly still has a 1980 Colorado inspection sticker. One of 16,155 similar cars built in 1955, the seller points out the low VIN, P5FH100082, as being of significant interest to collectors. This Thunderbird has a three-speed manual transmission and is described as 'all original except for the air cleaner.' The seller says the Thunderbird's odometer reading is accurate.</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86='' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1536568/20230322-163541.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1536568/20230322-163541.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1536568/20230322-163541.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>POWERTRAIN</strong></h3><p>This Thunderbird is powered by Ford's 292-cu.in. Y-block OHV V8. With a compression ratio of 8.1:1, the P-code engine received its fuel mixture via a single Holley four-barrel carburetor and was rated by the manufacturer at 193 horsepower when new. This Thunderbird's engine is reported to be original to the car, with an unknown rebuild history. The engine is said to start and idle well after a few pumps of the accelerator, without smoke. 'Minor engine seepage' is noted. The seller says the three-speed manual transmission 'shifts and performs well.' The engine bay presents as stock, except for an aftermarket air cleaner, and generally clean.</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1536560/20230326-140707.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1536560/20230326-140707.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1536560/20230326-140707.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1536586/20230322-164526.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1536586/20230322-164526.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1536586/20230322-164526.jpg' /></p><strong>EXTERIOR</strong><p>The date of the Thunderbird's apparent repaint in Torch Red is unknown but the seller terms the quality as 'good,' noting 'small splotches on the hood and front fender.' The convertible top is reported to be in proper, leak-free working order. The body seals are described as being in good condition, with no evidence of leaks. The car is equipped with rear fender skirts, and the chrome appears to be complete and in good overall condition. The glass is described as in 'good condition.' All lighting is said to work.

The carpeting shows no excessive wear and is termed 'good.' The steel dashboard shows no damage, and the Thunderbird's interior is reported to have all trim pieces and small controls. All instrumentation except the tach is said to work. The factory AM radio is reportedly inoperative. The heater is said to be in proper working order. The Thunderbird is optioned with power windows that are reported to be functional. The trunk appears to have a solid floor and presents as generally clean.

'It has never been run in the rain or in the winter,' says the seller, who adds the 47,500-mile and Flathead-powered sedan is in 'perfect running condition.' The car is also said to be 'rust-free' and in generally stock condition, but with a few upgrades intended to enhance drivability, including an electric fuel pump, aluminum radiator, and electric cooling fan. It also has a new gas tank. The transmission is paired with an overdrive unit that helps make highway driving more comfortable.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86='' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1647910/105360615.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1647910/105360615.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1647910/105360615.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>POWERTRAIN</strong></h3><p>Powered by a 100-horsepower version of the 239-cu.in. flathead V8, the engine in this classic Ford is said to be original and never rebuilt. With the assistance of the electric fuel pump and manual choke, it is said to start easily and idle 'beautifully,' with no smoke and no leaks. The cooling system has been upgraded with a thick aluminum radiator and electric fan (with a manual control in the cabin), which the seller says keeps things cool. The engine is paired with a three-speed manual transmission with manually engaged overdrive unit. It reportedly shifts smoothly and quietly. In fact, says the seller, the car 'runs perfect, including the overdrive.'&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1647889/img-6436.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1647889/img-6436.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1647889/img-6436.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1647923/img-6440.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1647923/img-6440.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1647923/img-6440.jpg' /></p><strong>EXTERIOR</strong><p>According to the seller, this Ford was painted 20 years with marine epoxy. The black finish appears very good and shiny, with the seller reporting no blemishes or swirl marks. The seller also asserts there's 'no rust in the body, no repairs and no filler.' He adds, 'it was undercoated in 1950.' The exterior chrome and trim appear in good condition. The car's glass is said to be in good shape, with no scratches or cracks, while the door and trunk seals are said to be intact, with no reported leaks. There are no noted issues with the exterior lights, which include a pair of backup lamps.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1647903/105360199.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1647903/105360199.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1647903/105360199.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1647911/105359983.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1647911/105359983.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1647911/105359983.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>INTERIOR</strong></h3><p>The cabin appears in very good condition and mostly original, although it appears the seats have been reupholstered with gray vinyl-and-cloth covers that the seller notes are in 'excellent' condition. The same reportedly goes for the carpet, while the headliner is said to be original and fully intact, with no tears, seam splits, or sagging. There are no apparent cracks in the steering wheel and the interior's pair of parlor lights remain functional, too, says the seller, along with the original gauges. The heater is said to be functional, as well. Switches for the electric fuel pump and electric cooling fan are the only add-ons to the interior.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1647881/105360684.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1647881/105360684.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1647881/105360684.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>CHASSIS</strong></h3><p>The chassis, suspension, and brake systems have been regularly inspected and serviced, according to the seller, including replacement shocks, replacement U-joints, and an 'all-new' brake system including the master cylinder and wheel cylinders.

According to the selling dealer who is representing this vehicle on consignment, 'This genuine J-code 426 Hemi [example] was an ordered car, with its options [and colors] hand-chosen by the first owner, right down to its [seldom seen] Burgundy Metallic paint paired with black and white interior. He adds, 'It was originally designated for export, a common occurrence for vehicles purchased by members of the armed forces.'&nbsp;</p><p>The seller continues, 'This car was purchased in Texas as a project and torn down to bare metal in 2007. Reportedly visually inspected by Galen Govier prior to its restoration, the Charger's primary and secondary body numbers on the radiator support and trunk rail were verified as intact and original, as was the factory fender tag and export tag.' He goes on to say, 'Upon completion of its rotisserie restoration around 2008, it was enjoyed for more than 10 years as a driven show car, logging nearly 4,000 miles. A comprehensive refresh, repaint, and O.E. correction of the engine bay was then completed in 2019. The current owner purchased the vehicle a month later for his private collection and has put less than 500 miles on it since.'</p><p>Its seller adds, 'The car has been professionally inspected to confirm its condition and mechanical fitness by a Chrysler Power West Judge and owner/restorer of his own 1968 Hemi Charger R/T.

'A vintage correct Mopar Performance 426 HEMI Crate Engine p/n P5249667AE was chosen to replace the long missing numbers matching motor. As with all genuine Mopar Crate engines, the seller reports it was built with all brand-new components 4,404 miles ago, including forged pistons, forged steel crank shaft, hydraulic cam shaft, premium double roller timing chain, and High-Performance Electronic Distributor. The factory rates it as 465 horsepower and 486 lb-ft of torque running a single carb. According to the seller, this one runs correct dual-quads so expect the horsepower to exceed 500. 'The compression ratio and modern valve seats allow you to run current high octane unleaded pump gas.' Upgrades for this application include correct appearing black crinkle valve covers, Dual-Quad HEMI intake, Carter AFB carburetors, and correct 'Chrome Dome' HEMI Air Cleaner assembly. 'Pump the gas pedal twice and turn the key,' he says. 'She fires right up, with no drama.'&nbsp;</p><p>A correct TorqueFlite three-speed automatic transmission 'shifts quick and crisply,' and the Sure-Grip rear differential is fitted with 3.23:1-gears, per the fender tag.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1598243/dsc-2620-result.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1598243/dsc-2620-result.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1598243/dsc-2620-result.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1598404/vaughn-125-result.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1598404/vaughn-125-result.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1598404/vaughn-125-result.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>EXTERIOR</strong></h3><p>'The entire body was dipped as part of the restoration,' the seller notes. 'Its floors and trunk pans are original, which is remarkable for a Mopar of this vintage. According to the inspector, the OEM quarter panels were repaired during the restoration, evidenced only by the absence of spray-in sound deadening on the inside each panel. The repairs are otherwise undetectable.'&nbsp;</p><p>Though refinished in 2008, by virtue of its 2019 repaint, the code-RR1 Burgundy Metallic finish is in 'excellent condition,' the seller says, as is the optional vinyl top.

He says, 'The car starts with one or two pumps of gas pedal. After being stored for many months (winter season), it may require a squirt of engine starter in the carburetor. Otherwise, it starts and runs fine with no leaks.' There are 'no issues' with the FMX three-speed automatic transmission, and 2.75:1 gears are in the rear axle.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1666018/104627141.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1666018/104627141.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1666018/104627141.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1666022/104627146.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1666022/104627146.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1666022/104627146.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>EXTERIOR</strong></h3><p>There's 'some spiderweb-type markings on what may be the original paint, but I can't be sure that it is,' the seller observes. 'While there's no rust at all, the Mercury could use a repaint, as the color has likely faded from when it was new,' he adds. 'The few small chips in the finish are easily fixable, however.' Its glass is 'in decent shape,' there are 'no water leaks,' and the exterior lighting functions.</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1666017/104627151.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1666017/104627151.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1666017/104627151.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1666021/104627155.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1666021/104627155.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1666021/104627155.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>INTERIOR</strong></h3><p>'The Dark Ivy Gold [code 6G] leather seats are showing their age with some cracks and small tears' the seller notes. The carpet is 'decent,' the headliner is 'good/fair with no sagging, but probably is not as tight as original/new,' and the trim is complete. All of the gauges work except for the fuel indicator and the heater/defroster operates properly, but parts of the A/C system were removed. The stereo was upgraded to an Alpine AM/FM cassette head unit and different speakers, which provide 'terrific sound,' he says.

No issues are reported with the steel wheels, the power steering, or power front disc/rear drum brakes. The wire wheel covers appear to be from a 1967 Cougar. He doesn't know if the suspension has received any work over the years, but says the shocks appear to be 'fine,' the steering wheel is straight when the vehicle is traveling straight, and there's no play in the system beyond that typical of a 1969 car.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1666013/cougar-134.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1666013/cougar-134.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1666013/cougar-134.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1666012/104627165.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1666012/104627165.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1666012/104627165.jpg' /></p>"

			"content": "<p>This 1941 Cadillac 62 coupe is one of fewer than 2,000 produced. After purchasing it from the second owner nearly 20 years ago, the seller drove the car in stock condition for a couple of years before diving into a nine-year, frame-off restomod rebuild. It has a number of modern amenities, from four-wheel disc brakes and an overdrive transmission to rack-and-pinion steering, digital gauges and air conditioning. There's also an LS6 crate engine under the hood. 'It has been on numerous long-distance trips with no issues — and it rides like a dream,' says the seller, who adds 90 percent of the car's 10,500 miles have been accumulated on the highway. This custom Caddy reported was also a 2017 NSRA National Award Winner.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1634275/1941-cadillac-coupe-20230505-095.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1634275/1941-cadillac-coupe-20230505-095.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1634275/1941-cadillac-coupe-20230505-095.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>POWERTRAIN</strong></h3><p>To keep Cadillac power under the hood, the seller swapped the original 'Monobloc' V8 engine for an early CTS-V LS6 crate engine with GM's high compression 243 heads, which generates over 450-hp.&nbsp; Ironically, both engines displaced 346 cubic inches (5.7 liters), with the LS6's 450-hp rating three times that of the original V8. In this Model 62, the engine is said to start, idle and run 'very well,' with no smoke or leaks. It's paired with a 4L60-E four-speed overdrive transmission that was reportedly rebuilt to support as much as 500 horsepower. There are no reported shifting issues or leaks.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1634186/1941-cadillac-coupe-20230505-007.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1634186/1941-cadillac-coupe-20230505-007.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1634186/1941-cadillac-coupe-20230505-007.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1634185/1941-cadillac-coupe-20230505-008.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1634185/1941-cadillac-coupe-20230505-008.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1634185/1941-cadillac-coupe-20230505-008.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>EXTERIOR</strong></h3><p>According to the seller, the body was professionally prepared and painted by Nagel Auto Body, in Waukesha, Wisconsin. 'It is absolutely beautiful, with no quality issues,' says the seller. Blemishes in the maroon paintwork reportedly include four 'very small' driving-incurred chips on the hood and front of the car, as well as a small chip on the driver's door. The seller also asserts the car has always been rust-free, noting: 'When the body and frame were stripped, there was no evidence of corrosion other than some surface rust on the frame.' The rear wheel wells were enlarged slightly to accommodate larger wheels and tires. Additionally, during the restoration the glass was replaced with bronze-tinted tempered glass and all the rubber moldings and seals were replaced. All are said to remain in very good condition. All the exterior lighting reportedly works and includes HID and LED lamps, as well as a third brake light incorporated in the body, above the trunk lid.</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1634229/1941-cadillac-coupe-20230505-050.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1634229/1941-cadillac-coupe-20230505-050.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1634229/1941-cadillac-coupe-20230505-050.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1634234/1941-cadillac-coupe-20230505-055.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1634234/1941-cadillac-coupe-20230505-055.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1634234/1941-cadillac-coupe-20230505-055.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>INTERIOR</strong></h3><p>This Caddy's cabin was also redone and features a number of modern and custom touches, starting with leather-trimmed, heated and power-adjustable seats from a 2008 Cadillac DTS. They're mounted over wool carpet that is said to be 'like new,' while the headliner was also replaced during the build. All the interior trim pieces are said to be intact and additional features included Dakota Digital instruments, door panels trimmed to match the seats, power front windows, an Alpine stereo system with Bluetooth capability and five speakers. The dashboard was also modified to accept vents for the air conditioning system, which reportedly blow cold. In fact, there are no reported functional issues with any of the car's interior features.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1582285/98807621.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1582285/98807621.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1582285/98807621.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1582257/98807613.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1582257/98807613.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1582257/98807613.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>CHASSIS</strong></h3><p>The chassis, suspension and braking elements were comprehensively revamped during the car's build and include a Mustang II-style front suspension from JW Rod Garage with power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering, Ride Tech air-ride suspension at all four corners and four-wheel disc brakes. The front brakes are from Wilwood, while the rear brakes are 12-inch Torino brakes attached to a John's Industries-built 9-inch axle fitted with 31-spline axles. There's also an Inland Empire Driveline-built two-piece driveshaft and support bearing. All elements are said to be in very good order, with no known issues or needs. In fact, the seller reports an alignment was performed in 2021 and suspension lubrication was performed in 2022. The car rides on 18-inch aluminum wheels wrapped with performance tires that were reportedly installed in 2020. They are said to have less than 1,200 miles on them — and the seller says there are no vibrations on the highway.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1634253/1941-cadillac-coupe-20230505-075.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1634253/1941-cadillac-coupe-20230505-075.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1634253/1941-cadillac-coupe-20230505-075.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1634202/1941-cadillac-coupe-20230505-024.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1634202/1941-cadillac-coupe-20230505-024.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1634202/1941-cadillac-coupe-20230505-024.jpg' /></p>"

That said, it was the starting point for the model that ultimately made development of its 1961<em>&nbsp;Neue Klasse</em>&nbsp;sedans viable, from which came the revered 2002 models that cemented the marque's place in the minds of automotive enthusiasts to this day. This 1958 BMW 600 Limousine, offered for sale on consignment from a private collection in Arkansas, has been restored to like-new condition.&nbsp;<br /> </p><p>Lacking the resources to design a much-needed car larger than the Isetta from scratch, BMW used the Isetta as the starting point for a 1957 model capable of seating four. Thus, the BMW 600, which the company does not refer to as an Isetta, shares that model's front hatch, as well as its overall mechanical layout.&nbsp;<br /> </p><p>However, the 600 supplanted the Isetta's one-cylinder engine with the BMW R67 motorcycle's flat twin engine and a semi trailing arm rear suspension system. The first BMW model to employ that setup, the company went on to employ semi-trailing arms on all of its production models until 1992.

Paired with a four-speed manual transmission feeding the rear wheels, the powertrain was said to be capable of propelling the microcar to a top speed of 68 miles per hour, with the engine turning 4,500 rpm. The BMW 600 was also offered with a Saxomat semi-automatic transmission.&nbsp;<br /> </p><p>The sub-57,000-mile engine in this example is mated to a four-speed manual transmission and is said by the seller to be original to the car and free of modifications. A manual choke is employed to start the engine when cold and the seller says it starts as it should. He acknowledges observing minor leaks in the past, but says. 'There has been nothing underneath the car lately.'

This 2005 Ford Mustang GT Saleen S281 is car #1103 and shows only 8,393 miles at the time of submission, according to the seller, who is also its original owner. Apart from the Saleen upgrades it has no additional modifications and reportedly has never been raced.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1697187/IMG_0189.JPEG' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1697187/IMG_0189.JPEG' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1697187/IMG_0189.JPEG' /></p><h3><strong>POWERTRAIN</strong></h3><p>The S281's engine upgrades build on Ford's three-valve, OHC 4.6-liter V8 foundation with underdrive pulleys, a low-restriction reusable air filter and engine tuning (requiring premium fuel), elevating the engine's output rating to 325 horsepower. There's also a unique exhaust system that features twin mufflers and a vacuum-actuated bypass valve, for less restriction and a throatier engine note under wide-open throttle. The seller reports the engine starts, idles and runs well, with no known issues, no smoke and no leaks. The same goes for the five-speed manual gearbox, which is said to 'shift well.'&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1697158/IMG_0159.JPEG' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1697158/IMG_0159.JPEG' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1697158/IMG_0159.JPEG' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1697157/IMG_0158.JPEG' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1697157/IMG_0158.JPEG' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1697157/IMG_0158.JPEG' /></p><h3><strong>EXTERIOR</strong></h3><p>According to the seller, the Sonic Blue paintwork on this Saleen S281 is in 'excellent' original condition, with no blemishes. Further, the seller reports 'zero' rust, 'excellent' glass and seals and functional exterior lighting. Additional features unique to the S81 include the front and rear fascias, the rocker covers and a distinctive rear-end extension that incorporates a low rear spoiler. The taillight panel trim is also unique, along with Saleen's signature graphics on the doors and the car's build number on the front fascia.

All of the interior trim is reported to be in 'excellent' original condition. The only notable wear on the seat covers, carpet and other trim is found on the driver's seat-bottom bolster. All of the power accessories, as well as the air-conditioning system, interior lights and gauges, are reported functional, and the car retains its original Shaker 500 CD audio system, which reportedly works normally.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1697224/IMG_0009.JPEG' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1697224/IMG_0009.JPEG' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1697224/IMG_0009.JPEG' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1697223/IMG_0006.JPEG' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1697223/IMG_0006.JPEG' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1697223/IMG_0006.JPEG' /></p><h3><strong>CHASSIS</strong></h3><p>The chassis, suspension and braking components are reported to be in stock condition, per the upgrades performed by Saleen, which include specific springs, dampers and stabilizer bars, which all complement the Mustang's strut-type front suspension and three-link-located solid rear axle. There are no reported issues or needs with the suspension or brakes. Additionally, the car rolls on the original Dunlop high-performance tires mounted on the Saleen 20-inch alloy wheels. The tires appear to show most of their tread and there are no reported blemishes or curb rash in the chrome wheels.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1697134/13jpg.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1697134/13jpg.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1697134/13jpg.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1697231/img-0221-1jpeg.JPEG' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1697231/img-0221-1jpeg.JPEG' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1697231/img-0221-1jpeg.JPEG' /></p>"

			"content": "<p>The word 'Hellcat' speaks for itself these days, as the Charger and Challenger variants are supercharged modern muscle cars that redefined the capability and boundaries for factory performance. This example—a 2015 Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat—has less than 8,300 miles on the odometer, according to the seller, who notes it also is equipped with the comparatively rare six-speed manual transmission. According to published records, only 243 of the 7,168 Challenger Hellcats produced for the 2015 came in this example's Jazz Blue exterior color, which was the rarest color of the year. Production was split between 129 automatic-equipped cars and 114 with the six-speed, like this one.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1633566/2015-dodge-challenger-hellcat-engine-front.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1633566/2015-dodge-challenger-hellcat-engine-front.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1633566/2015-dodge-challenger-hellcat-engine-front.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>POWERTRAIN</strong></h3><p>This Hellcat is powered by Chrysler's supercharged 6.2-liter Gen III Hemi OHV V8 engine, which uses a twin-screw supercharger to help produce 707 horsepower and 650 lb-ft of torque. The seller notes the engine is in original condition, with no modifications, and it is said to 'start right up,' with no smoke and no leaks.

The car's glass is reportedly in great shape, too, with no scratches or chips, and the same goes for the condition of door and trunk seals. All the exterior lights reportedly work normally.

As with the exterior, the seller notes the cabin in this low-mileage muscle car is in 'great condition,' with essentially no apparent wear in the seats, carpet, door panels, or other interior trim, which includes metallic-appearing accents. The air conditioning, gauges and other power accessories all are said to operate normally and the factory sound system, which is linked to the 8.4-inch infotainment screen with satellite radio capability, is said to work 'perfectly.' &nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1633532/2015-dodge-challenger-hellcat-undercarrige-exhaust.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1633532/2015-dodge-challenger-hellcat-undercarrige-exhaust.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1633532/2015-dodge-challenger-hellcat-undercarrige-exhaust.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1633534/2015-dodge-challenger-hellcat-undercarrige-front-suspension.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1633534/2015-dodge-challenger-hellcat-undercarrige-front-suspension.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1633534/2015-dodge-challenger-hellcat-undercarrige-front-suspension.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>CHASSIS</strong></h3><p>The chassis, suspension, and Brembo brakes are in stock condition and have seen little service.

Additionally, the engine compartment appears very clean.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1656868/exterior-3.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1656868/exterior-3.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1656868/exterior-3.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1656855/exterior-9.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1656855/exterior-9.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1656855/exterior-9.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>EXTERIOR</strong></h3><p>The Oxford White/Azure Blue exterior of this low-mile Shelby GT350 is said by the seller be in very good condition, with only a few small reported blemishes in the original paintwork. They include one on the nose, above the mesh grille, one near the fuel door and some black specks on the hood. All are documented in the photos. The glass and seals are said to be 'like new,' with no scratches or cracks in the windshield and no leaks from the seals. All the exterior lights are reportedly in working condition. The seller also asserts the body is 'rust-free.' GT500 front and rear spoilers have been added in addition to the exterior upgrades that were part of the GT350 package.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1656796/interior-4.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1656796/interior-4.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1656796/interior-4.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1656870/interior-26.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1656870/interior-26.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1656870/interior-26.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>INTERIOR</strong></h3><p>As with the exterior and engine compartment, the seller describes this low-mileage GT350's black leather interior as being in great condition, with little apparent wear. It was ordered with an upgraded interior package, with Shelby/Katzkin leather, Recaro seats, and embroidered Shelby logos. There's also a Shelby plaque mounted on the console and a trio of A-pillar-mounted auxiliary gauges. The seat covers are reportedly in 'excellent' shape, along with the carpet and headliner. There are no missing trim parts, according to the seller, and all the interior gauges and features such as the air conditioning, Ford Shaker audio system, and power accessories, are said to work normally.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1672719/undercarriage-5.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1672719/undercarriage-5.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1672719/undercarriage-5.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1672721/undercarriage-6.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1672721/undercarriage-6.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1672721/undercarriage-6.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>CHASSIS</strong></h3><p>The chassis, brakes, and suspension are in stock condition, says the seller, and show little wear. All of the components are original, according to the seller, with Shelby upgrades including the Ford Racing-derived Shelby Track Package (dampers and bushings) and Shelby-logo Wilwood brake calipers. There are no reported issues with any of the systems and the car rolls on the original Goodyear Eagle F1 Supercar tires mounted on Shelby/Cragar 19-inch aluminum wheels. The wheels are said to be in great condition and the nine-year-old tires reportedly show 7/32-inch tread depth.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1656818/interior-18.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1656818/interior-18.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1656818/interior-18.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1656857/docs-2.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1656857/docs-2.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1656857/docs-2.jpg' /></p>"

			"description": "The seller states that this vehicle will be sold on a clean Colorado title in his and his wife's names. The additional paperwork is extensive and includes the following: the original dealership purchase order; the original owner's manuals with the Protect-O-Plate; the original window sticker that shows the extensive options included on the car; and PHS documentation. He adds, 'I have invoices dating back to 1983.' To aid in verifying the mileage, he says that 'the Colorado Safety Sticker on the original windshield was issued on 10/11/1980—the last year of that program—and it lists the mileage at 38,709. An included 1994 classic car appraisal lists the mileage at 42,685.' The toy stuffed tiger (see photo) is an original promotional gift from the dealer. This well-preserved 1966 Pontiac  GTO Hardtop Coupe hasn't required a restoration. It's loaded with highly desirable options and dealer accessories, has moderately low mileage, and is being offered by the family that originally ordered the car new from the dealer. Thus, a new owner can soon enjoy entertaining fellow cruise-night participants by discussing all of those attributes.",

Its engine, drivetrain, paint, interior, and suspension remain original to the car, according to the seller.</p><p>'I was 12 years old when on May 13, 1966 I went with my parents to pick up our new car at Johnson Pontiac in Colorado Springs.' he remembers. 'My father was meticulous with his vehicles, and my mother was a middle school teacher at the time and drove the GTO to and from school for the next two years.</p><p>'By 1969 they were driving it sparingly. When my father passed away in 1993, my mother decided to keep the GTO in storage, rarely taking it out for a drive. I would try to start it up once every three months to keep the seals lubricated. I inherited the car in 2020 and took it to a few shows, but none recently. This Pontiac has always been stored and driven in Colorado.' Significant documentation accumulated over the last 57 years will be included with the car.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1657240/img-2581.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1657240/img-2581.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1657240/img-2581.jpg' /></p><h3>POWERTRAIN</h3><p>The Goat's coveted 360-hp, 424 lb-ft of torque, 389-cu.in., Tri-Power V8 (code-YR) has never required a rebuild, per the seller. In 1998, it was removed, new seals and gaskets were installed, and it was repainted before reinstallation. Additional service has included replacing the exhaust resonators in 2013; the battery in 2023; and the transmission seals, rear differential cover gasket, blower motor relay, resister connector, and transmission mount in 2019. The A/C was evacuated and recharged at that time.&nbsp;</p><p>'If the car hasn't been started for some time, I pour a very small amount of gas in the center carburetor, pump the accelerator three times, and crank the engine,' the seller explains. If the car was driven the day before, it usually starts after three quick accelerator pumps. I let it warm up before putting it in gear.' Leaks were fixed 'as they occurred' so there are none noted at the time of listing. The two-speed ST300 (Super Turbine) automatic transmission 'shifts fine,' and out back is a code-YE 3.08:1-geared Safe-T-Track axle.</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1657243/105623840.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1657243/105623840.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1657243/105623840.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1657333/105624084.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1657333/105624084.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1657333/105624084.jpg' /></p><h3>EXTERIOR</h3><p>Original Palmetto Green (code-H) paint remains, but is 'showing a little age with slight color fade and mottling on the hood and trunk,' according to a 2022 appraisal. 'There are minimal parking lot dings covered with touch-up paint, chips across the nose, a dent in the right side of the nose, and a very small surface rust spot at the right lower corner of the backlite,' the seller adds. Its factory-installed black Cordova (vinyl) top is 'in excellent condition,' the glass and seals are original, 'there is no evidence of water leaks,' and all of the lights work.</p><p>The seller add that when the car was one month old his father accessorized and customized with the following touches: faux front fender vents from the Le Mans; chrome headlight covers; red vinyl pinstriping over the standard painted black pinstripe and on the louvered taillights; a hood-mounted bug deflector; curb feelers; and red fender liners.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1657338/img-2612.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1657338/img-2612.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1657338/img-2612.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1657315/img-2422.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1657315/img-2422.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1657315/img-2422.jpg' /></p><h3>INTERIOR</h3><p>Inside, the original black Morrokide (vinyl) seat covers are 'in very good condition,' the seller notes, and the carpet, floor mats, and headliner are 'excellent.' There's a small tear in the driver's headrest, however. The optional Rally gauges; the A/C; AM/FM radio with front and rear speakers; reverberator; power antenna, driver's seat, and deck lid release; reclining passenger seat; tilt wheel; heater/defroster; rear window defogger; and the interior lights are in proper working order, and the trim is all there. He goes on to say, 'In June of 1966, my father added faux wood decor on the center console, tissue dispenser, and steering wheel, and the dealer added the dash compass.'</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1657205/img-2357.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1657205/img-2357.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1657205/img-2357.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1657248/img-2351.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1657248/img-2351.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1657248/img-2351.jpg' /></p><h3>CHASSIS</h3><p>The suspension remains original down to the rear air shocks, the seller says, but the chassis does appear to have been repainted black at some point. 'I check their pressure every year, and there are no visible leaks on the shocks or damaged bushings,' he reveals. The front wheels bearings were inspected and repacked and the seals were replaced in 2019. There are 'no issues' with the power-assisted four-wheel drum brakes.&nbsp;</p><p>There are 'no highway vibrations,' and the leak-free power steering and the ride are 'smooth,' he reports. The tires are believed to be from the early 1990s. The spare tire is the original Firestone. When the car was new, the seller's father had the dealer install 1965 stainless-steel knock-off spinner wheel covers,' (aka 'Custom').</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1657287/img-2625.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1657287/img-2625.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1657287/img-2625.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1657334/img-2080.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1657334/img-2080.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1657334/img-2080.jpg' /></p>"

'It's an iconic-looking muscle car with no real issues,' adds the seller.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1665959/2022-06-01-09.04.45.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1665959/2022-06-01-09.04.45.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1665959/2022-06-01-09.04.45.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>POWERTRAIN</strong></h3><p>The engine under this Pontiac's hood is said to be a rebuilt 1969 such as a Pontiac GTO 400-cu.in. OHV V8 with less than 3,000 miles on it. Its equipment includes a Comp Cams '269' High-Energy camshaft, an Edelbrock aluminum intake manifold, a 750-cfm Edelbrock four-barrel carburetor, headers, an HEI-style ignition, and more. The engine reportedly starts easily and runs well. There is no reported smoke and no leaks. The transmission is a rebuilt Turbo Hydra-Matic 400 three-speed automatic, says the seller, which has a 2,000-rpm-stall torque converter. There are no reported performance issues or leaks with it. Additional drivetrain components include Flowmaster mufflers, an aluminum radiator with a pair of electric fans, and a Positraction rear axle with 3.31 gears.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1665930/88869066-0-0.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1665930/88869066-0-0.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1665930/88869066-0-0.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1665929/96357475.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1665929/96357475.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1665929/96357475.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>EXTERIOR</strong></h3><p>Reportedly painted about four years ago, the Marimba Red finish on this GTO clone has a deep, high-quality gloss that 'really makes the car stand out,' according to the seller. There are no known blemishes or swirl marks in the paint. In addition to the GTO trim, the white convertible top was also new and reportedly operates normally — but latching it can be difficult in colder weather. Additionally, the seller says that all glass and rubber seals are in 'great' condition. All the exterior lights reportedly work normally.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1665948/96355915.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1665948/96355915.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1665948/96355915.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1665952/88925920-0-0.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1665952/88925920-0-0.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1665952/88925920-0-0.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>INTERIOR</strong></h3><p>Inside, the white vinyl cabin appears in very good, restored condition, with most of it replaced or refurbished during the project, according to the seller. As with the exterior, GTO trim was added, including the engine-turned instrument panel insert, along with new seat covers, door panels, and carpet. The dash insert, however, appears to be a factory piece and shows some wear, as does some of the other interior trim that the seller states is brand new. The dashboard also appears in very good condition but does have a crack and aftermarket enhancements include a wood-rimmed steering wheel, a trio of auxiliary gauges, and a retro-style radio with modern capabilities. All the gauges are said to be functional, along with the heater. The car was originally equipped with air conditioning, but the system has been deleted. The original AC vents and evaporator units are complete and in place on the dashboard and in the firewall should the next owner decide to add AC it would be easily reinstalled with compressor and lines.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1665964/IMG_1872.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1665964/IMG_1872.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1665964/IMG_1872.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1665963/IMG_1871.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1665963/IMG_1871.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1665963/IMG_1871.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>CHASSIS</strong></h3><p>The seller reports the chassis, suspension, and braking systems are in good condition and were addressed during the restoration. Upgrades are said to include a quicker-ratio steering box, a complete suspension rebuild with poly bushings, a 1-inch front anti-sway bar and a 7/8-inch rear anti-sway bar. The shocks were also replaced, and the brakes were upgraded to front discs (mounted on Chevrolet S-10 spindles). The brakes, however, need adjustments at low speeds, says the seller, who adds 'they do not stop the car as quick as you would like.' Rolling stock includes BFGoodrich Radial T/A tires mounted on Weld Racing 15-inch wheels. All are reportedly in very good condition, showing minimal wear and no reported blemishes on the wheels. The tires appear to show 2013 manufacturing dates.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1665946/96357491.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1665946/96357491.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1665946/96357491.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1665981/img-1577.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1665981/img-1577.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1665981/img-1577.jpg' /></p>"

From the factory, the 1.6-liter DOHC inline-four was rated at 125 horsepower. In the past five years, he states he has replaced the spark plugs and wires, distributor cap and rotor, and had the pair of Weber carburetors rebuilt. Despite the addition of a Crane Cams Fireball XR700 ignition system, the engine has a misfire at idle that the seller notes 'smooths out above 3,000 rpm.' A recent compression test showed 175 psi in all four cylinders. He also states that it takes a few tries to start when cold. The transmission is the stock five-speed manual that the seller says 'shifts fine,' with 'no clunks or thumps.' He notes slight weeping from the differential.</p><p><br />Beyond the engine and clutch installation, the seller notes, it had some work done at the local Alfa Romeo dealer in 2001 which included fluid and filter changes, brakes, and the addition of a CraneCams Fireball XR700 ignition, rear Ansa exhaust, removal and cleaning of the gas tank, and a replacement radiator. He states he retained some of the receipts for that work done and in the past five years has replaced the fuel pump and battery. In the past year, the seller has had the spark plug wires and plugs, cap and rotor, fuel filter and the Weber carburetors rebuilt and most recently an oil and filter change.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1671834/111082338.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1671834/111082338.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1671834/111082338.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1671892/111081528.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1671892/111081528.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1671892/111081528.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>EXTERIOR</strong></h3><p>The car wears a red repaint that was completed before the seller acquired it in 1998. He acknowledges 'plenty of imperfections, small dents, scratches, and chips,' which are visible in the photos. The driver's-side door sags slightly in its opening but the seller says it closes and latches fine. Likewise, the trunk latches but 'doesn't seal tightly and the rubber trunk molding needs to be replaced' and the convertible top closes but the seller says its missing some trim pieces and needs replacement.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1671867/111083574.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1671867/111083574.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1671867/111083574.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1671802/dsc05878.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1671802/dsc05878.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1671802/dsc05878.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>INTERIOR</strong></h3><p>There's not much more to a Duetto interior than a pair of seats and a dashboard, which is good for longevity—there's less to wear out. The black vinyl bucket seats were reupholstered at an unknown time prior to the seller acquiring the car, and he says that 'all adjustments work properly.' The carpet is worn and will need to be replaced. The seller notes a set of rubber floor mats for the interior and trunk compartment are included but not shown in the photos. All knobs, switches, and gauges work, though the seller indicates that the fuel gauge can be 'moody' at times. Many trim pieces are worn. An aftermarket radio of unknown origin provides AM/FM reception but no modern capabilities.</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1671856/111086333.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1671856/111086333.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1671856/111086333.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1671794/111086268.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1671794/111086268.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1671794/111086268.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>CHASSIS</strong></h3><p>The undercarriage looks like that of a typical old car—surface rust, but no apparent structural concerns. The seller says it needs shocks, an inner tie-rod end. The car goes down the road straight, he says, with no unusual play or vagueness that he can detect, but the steering wheel is cocked to the left. He notes vibration at some speeds which may be attributable to tire balancing or flat spots.&nbsp;</p><p>It wears three of the same tires today as it did when the seller bought the car: BFGoodrich Comp T/As measuring 215/60R14 on aftermarket Cromodora wheels, 1 inch smaller than stock. As noted, he's only driven the Duetto about 1,500 miles, but they've been on it for at least 25 years. The right rear tire is a Riken Raptor fitted about a year ago after the BFG went flat. The seller notes no pulsing or vibration from the brakes, although he says the car does pull a bit to the right under braking. He reports that the pedal is firm and will lock up the tires with enough pressure.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1671881/dsc05875.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1671881/dsc05875.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1671881/dsc05875.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1671822/dsc05889.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1671822/dsc05889.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1671822/dsc05889.jpg' /></p>"

			"content": "<p>Now celebrating its 60th year of production, the Porsche 911 has attained legendary status. Rather than starting over from scratch with a clean-sheet design every so often, as is the norm for most manufacturers, Porsche has steadily improved every aspect of the 911 over time. Its basic silhouette has evolved over the past 60 years, not changed radically. Similarly, while the basic layout of the car remains the same as the original, the 911 has been treated to ever more powerful engines (water cooled since 1998), along with steadily improved braking and handling and continually upgraded creature comforts over the years. This sixth-generation 2006 Porsche 911 Carrera, offered for sale by a dealer in Naperville, Illinois, features a six-speed manual transmission and is known in Porsche's internal nomenclature as the 997.</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1615579/55-dsc03623.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1615579/55-dsc03623.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1615579/55-dsc03623.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>POWERTRAIN</strong></h3><p>This 911 is powered by a normally aspirated, water-cooled, 3.6-liter DOHC flat-six. A six-speed manual transmission feeds power to the rear wheels. Porsche rated the engine at 325 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque when new. The seller represents the powerplant as being 'original,'. According to the seller, there are no issues with cold starts, no smoke, nor any leaks or weeps to report. The transmission is said to be 'perfect.'</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1615532/14-dsc03575.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1615532/14-dsc03575.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1615532/14-dsc03575.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1615535/20-dsc03581.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1615535/20-dsc03581.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1615535/20-dsc03581.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>EXTERIOR</strong></h3><p>The seller characterizes the car's black paint as being in 'mint' condition and says the body is free of blemishes. All glass is reported to be in 'mint' condition as well.&nbsp; The sunroof is said to work, and all seals are said to be free from leaks. Represented as a 'rust free' car, the seller also says there are no body modifications.

The carpet's condition is characterized as being 'mint.' The Alcantara headliner shows well, aside from a scratch on the panel upholstering the sunroof, which is visible in the photographs. All interior trim is also characterized as being 'mint.' The climate control's temperature and fan speed buttons have been covered with an aftermarket decal. All instrumentation is reported to work, as are the power windows, door locks, and the infotainment system. Heat and A/C are also stated to be functional.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1615581/61-dsc03632.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1615581/61-dsc03632.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1615581/61-dsc03632.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>CHASSIS</strong></h3><p>The power steering system is said to exhibit no play. The suspension system, including the bushings and shocks, is represented as being original. The accompanying photography shows the Continental Extreme Contact tires have good tread remaining, though there is a blemish in the sidewall of the right front. The front tires carry 2016 DOT date codes, while the rears display 2018 codes. All four wheels show well in the photographs, with no pitting and only minimal curb rash evident.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1615548/28-dsc03586.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1615548/28-dsc03586.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1615548/28-dsc03586.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1615675/60-dsc03627.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1615675/60-dsc03627.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1615675/60-dsc03627.jpg' /></p>"

			"content": "<p>The sixth-generation Nissan Z, known by the company's internal designation as 'Z34,' went into production in 2008 for a 2009 model year introduction. The convertible version of the 370Z followed the coupe to market in 2010. The Z33 models it replaced had ended a six-year hiatus, during which Nissan's Z was not offered in the United States. Eschewing the luxuries that made its Z32 300ZX predecessor as much grand-tourer as sports car, the Z33 was closer in concept to the original S30 240Z, which had been introduced in 1969 as a 1970 model. In turn, the Z34 was lighter, wider, lower, and shorter than the Z33, plus it boasted a larger engine. This unmodified 2012 Nissan 370Z Convertible Touring is offered for sale by a dealer in Oklahoma City and features a seven-speed automatic transmission.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1619968/img-4029.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1619968/img-4029.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1619968/img-4029.jpg' /></p><h3>POWERTRAIN</h3><p>Nissan's sixth generation Z employed a naturally aspirated 3.7-liter DOHC V6, capable of producing 332 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque. The VQ37VHR engine redlined at 7,500 rpm and was quoted as propelling the car to 60 mph in less than five seconds. In this instance, the engine is mated to Nissan's Jatco seven-speed automatic transmission, which sends output to the rear wheels. The seller represents the engine as being original, with no modifications or rebuilds. The engine is said to 'start right up' when cold and exhibits 'no visible leaks or weeps.'&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1619957/img-4007.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1619957/img-4007.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1619957/img-4007.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1598884/4.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1598884/4.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1598884/4.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>EXTERIOR</strong></h3><p>According to the seller, the Brilliant Silver paint is original and there have been no modifications to the bodywork. 'One very small scratch on the hood and less than a handful of very small paint chips' are the paint's only reported blemishes. The folding canvas roof is purported to have no leaks or missing components. The seller does note the convertible top 'has to be assisted when opening and closing to keep from snagging on the trunk lid.' Glass and windows are said to be in good condition and all seals are said to display 'no evidence' of leaks. 'No rust is visible,' says the seller and all lights are said by the seller to work.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1587418/img-4020.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1587418/img-4020.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1587418/img-4020.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1587416/img-4022.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1587416/img-4022.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1587416/img-4022.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>INTERIOR</strong></h3><p>The black cloth upholstery shows well in the accompanying photograph—save what appears to be some staining on both the driver's and passenger's seats. The seller says the cloth seats have 'no visible cracks or tears and adjust as they should.' The carpets are characterized as being in 'great condition' and the seller notes there are no floormats. The roof's headliner is also described as being in 'great condition' with 'no sags.' All instrumentation is said to be working, as is the aftermarket Kenwood head unit, which the seller says offers Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. Power windows and door locks are reported to be working. As for the interior trim, the seller notes, 'The only missing item is the passenger side SRS airbag button cover.'

The provided photos seem to show minor surface corrosion on the undercarriage, commensurate with the car's age and mileage. The black factory wheels are said by the seller to exhibit 'no visible curb rash or pitting.' While the age of the tires is said to be unknown, the seller notes they have 'lots of tread remaining.'

In yet another first, the E36/7 Z3 was the first BMW roadster to be built in the United States, at the company's Spartanburg, South Carolina manufacturing facility. The original owner, whose wife purchased the car for him new in May of 2002, is offering this 2002 BMW Z3 2.5i Convertible, with a five-speed manual transmission and BMW's maple wood trim.</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1600531/98606112.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1600531/98606112.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1600531/98606112.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>POWERTRAIN</strong></h3><p>BMW got 184 horsepower and 175 lb-ft of torque from its B25 normally aspirated 2.5-liter DOHC inline-six, an example of which powers the Z3 roadster offered here. According to the seller, this is the original engine, with no modifications. The seller says all preventive maintenance has been performed as recommended, including oil changes, coolant changes, and brake fluid changes. The Getrag 250 five-speed manual transmission, characterized as 'normal shifting without any clunks or thumps,' conducts engine output to the rear wheels. The seller says there are 'no problems with cold start, no special process required to start the engine, no smoke, and normal idle.' The seller also states there are no leaks or weeps and most of the 114,000 miles were on the Natchez Trace Parkway during the 15 years he worked in Tupelo, MS, and drove between Nashville and Tupelo, 200 miles each way.</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1602697/img-3659.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1602697/img-3659.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1602697/img-3659.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1602696/img-3660.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1602696/img-3660.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1602696/img-3660.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>EXTERIOR</strong></h3><p>The bodywork shows well in the accompanying photographs, save for a slight scratch reported by the seller on the front bumper.&nbsp; Aside from that, the Atlanta Blue Metallic paint is said to be 'excellent.'

			"content": "<p>This restored 1974 BMW 2002, offered for sale by a private owner in Brick, New Jersey, features a four-speed manual transmission. Per the seller, all of its systems were either refurbished or replaced as needed during the car's restoration. A near barn find, the seller says, 'I found the car sitting at a local repair shop for sale. The owner had passed and the car was sitting near a barn. It ran, so I drove it home where I determined it was all-original. I want to never see 2002 BMWs off the road and junked, so I restored this one and am offering it for sale.'<br /> </p><p>The seeds for the BMW 2002 were planted in 1967, when two of the company's executives met at a company workshop and discovered they had something in common. Unbeknownst to one another, each of them had replaced the 1.6-liter engines in their BMW coupes with 2.0-liter engines in a quest for greater performance. Their shared enthusiasm led them to put forth a proposal to the company's board to offer cars configured this way, and the 2002 was born. There were three generations of the BMW 2002 over the eight and a half years of the model's production run of 410,497 cars. First generation 2002s were manufactured between 1968 and 1971. The second generation, or model 71, was built between 1971 and 1973. And the third generation—model 73—was produced between 1973 and 1976, when the 320i replaced the 2002.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1595960/99055625.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1595960/99055625.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1595960/99055625.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>POWERTRAIN</strong></h3><p>Capable of propelling the diminutive coupe to a top speed of 130 miles per hour, the 2.0-liter carbureted SOHC inline-four was rated at 100 horsepower and 116 lb-ft of torque when new. The car's 0 to 60 mph time was quoted at a then-impressive 7.3 seconds. This 75,000-mile example is paired with a four-speed manual transmission, which sends the engine's output to the rear wheels. According to the seller, the unmodified engine in this car was serviced by a BMW mechanic in preparation for this sale and has 'no issues.' To conduct a cold start, the seller says, 'pump the throttle once, set the choke, and turn the key.' The engine is said to 'idle fine, and never exhibit any smoke.' The seller also reports there are no issues with the shifting of the transmission. Both the engine and the transmission are said to be free of leaks and weeps as well.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1645243/99055627.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1645243/99055627.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1645243/99055627.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1645244/99055626.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1645244/99055626.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1645244/99055626.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>EXTERIOR</strong></h3><p>'An $8,000 basecoat, clearcoat paint job [in&nbsp;<em>Siennabrun</em>] was applied six months ago,' says the seller, and 'there are no body blemishes.' All glass and windows are reported to be original, free of damage, and 'perfect.' Body seals were replaced, according to the seller, and the car is said to have no leaks. A new fender was fitted at the left front corner and the accompanying marker light was replaced with a new one to deal with a rust issue, according to the seller. With that fix in place, the seller declares the car to have 'no rust.' There are no other body modifications reported and all lighting instruments are said to be working. The heater is also said to work and the car has no A/C.</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1595971/99055634.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1595971/99055634.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1595971/99055634.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1607818/img-2704.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1607818/img-2704.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1607818/img-2704.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>INTERIOR</strong></h3><p>The tan vinyl interior is declared by the seller to be original and in 'excellent condition.' All seat adjustments are said to work. The carpeting is reported as being new and the headliner is said to exhibit no sag. The dome lights are also stated by the seller to work, and he says their switches in the doorframes were replaced. All of the gauges are described as working, with 'no issues.' The car's audio system is anchored by what the seller says is a new Blaupunkt CD unit. He says the speakers were replaced with new ones as well. The seller also says he had a USB port installed in the center console to support phone charging. Aside from that, the seller asserts there are no other modifications to the interior. The hand-cranked windows are reported to be functioning as are the manually operated door locks.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1645237/img-2439.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1645237/img-2439.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1645237/img-2439.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1645668/d33119.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1645668/d33119.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1645668/d33119.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>CHASSIS</strong></h3><p>There are no suspension system modifications, neither is there any play in the steering wheel, based upon the seller's assertions. Bushings and shocks are said by the seller to be in 'good general condition, good working order, and no suspension work is needed at this time.' The shocks are said by the seller to exhibit no leaks. Similarly, he reports no issues with the brakes. The 175/70R13 Kumho Solus tires are declared by the seller to be 'just about new,' confirmed by the mid-2020 DOT date codes. All five of the factory wheels were restored, painted in BMW silver, and fitted with new center caps according to the seller.</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1607619/img-2666.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1607619/img-2666.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1607619/img-2666.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1607762/img-2764.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1607762/img-2764.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1607762/img-2764.jpg' /></p>"

The Volvo is described by the seller as 'original,' the only departures apparently being aftermarket wheels and a performance air filter.

The 2CV became popular throughout Europe, getting a sales boost after the 1973 oil embargo. About 3.8 million were made, and it has also become something of a cult classic.&nbsp;</p><p>The seller reports that this 1989 Citroën 2CV6 was originally imported into the U.S. in 1997 by the late David Allen, who was well-known in the Citroën community for bringing in these cars.

This car, which came near the end of the 2CV's 42-year production run, was one of about 42,000 made in Citroën's Mangualde, Portugal plant, which built this model only for its final two years.

This car features a frame original to the 1989 car and serial number plate from 1970, which is the same year on the title that the car is registered as. The car is presented as with no needs.</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1638876/104829993.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1638876/104829993.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1638876/104829993.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>POWERTRAIN</strong></h3><p>The '6' in the model name indicates the 602-cc version of the air-cooled flat-twin engine that had been introduced for 1967. In the 1989 2CV6 model, this engine was factory-rated at 29 horsepower at 5,750 rpm and 28 lb-ft of peak torque at 3,500 rpm. The seller says the engine is original. 'To start, pull the choke out and turn the key. The engine starts quickly, and then slowly push the choke off and the engine idles properly.' The car has 'no leaks or weeps of any kind,' he says. The four-speed manual transmission is said to shift properly.</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1647366/104829234.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1647366/104829234.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1647366/104829234.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1647368/104830507.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1647368/104830507.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1647368/104830507.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>EXTERIOR</strong></h3><p>The seller states that the car has 'no rust' and that the paint is factory original with no touch ups or repaint, and he reports there are 'no blemishes.'

The seat material is believed to be factory original and is described as in 'fine condition' with no rips, stains, or other issues. The seats move back and forth properly, and the seat recliner (driver only) works correctly. The car's headliner is in 'good shape' with 'no sagging, stains, or signs of leaks,' and the dome lights work properly, per the seller. He affirms that the heat and gauges work properly.

The seller affirms that all chassis components are working properly and that the only suspension service on the vehicle has been a chassis lube that he performed. There is no curb rash or pitting on the original steel wheels, per the seller. He says new, correct Michelin X 125R15 tires were installed by the prior owner in 2016.

The fixed steel roof also improves the car's structural rigidity. The GT's styling was honed by the noted Italian design house Pininfarina, and it did its work well. At least one automotive pundit has said, 'The handsome fixed-roof GT is the connoisseur's MGB.' &nbsp;</p><p>This 1973 MGB GT, for sale at no reserve, is said by the seller to be 'rust-free' and originally from California. The Damask Red car has a four-speed manual transmission with overdrive and can 'comfortably cruise along at highway speeds,' according to the seller. He says the 'brakes and suspension have been recently serviced,' and the car has had 'upgrades to various electrical systems to make it run strong and reliable.' He notes, 'I really enjoy driving it around town and on the back roads [but] my storage facility sold their building,' so it's 'time to move on.' &nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1650535/104861180.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1650535/104861180.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1650535/104861180.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>POWERTRAIN</strong></h3><p>This MGB-GT came from the factory with a 1.8-liter 'B-series' OHV inline-four. Made of cast iron, it breathes through a pair of SU carburetors and, when new, was quoted as producing 78.5 horsepower and 94 lb-ft of torque. The seller says this car's engine was 'rebuilt by the previous owner in 2014.' He mentions that the cylinders were bored .060 inches over the factory size and that new pistons, rings, bearings, water pump, and seals were installed along with an electronic ignition system, aluminum radiator, and stainless-steel exhaust system. Photos of the engine bay and underbody appear to confirm his statements. The previous owner is said to have installed a 'fast road' cam for 'extra power.' The seller believes the engine is original to the car.&nbsp;</p><p>To start the car from cold, the seller 'waits for the fuel pump to build pressure' then 'gives it a little crank without any choke or throttle,' at which point he'll 'turn on the choke,' and it 'starts right up.' He says, 'nothing smokes,' and the engine is 'generally leak-free.' &nbsp;</p><p>Engine power is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transmission with a Laycock de Normanville overdrive unit. The overdrive operates on 3rd and 4th gears, producing the effect of a six-speed transmission. According to the seller, the car's present transmission and overdrive were installed by the previous owner, and a new clutch was installed at 'around 80,000 miles.' He says there are 'two small leaks' associated with the transmission and overdrive, but shift quality is 'smooth.' &nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1650548/104861255.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1650548/104861255.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1650548/104861255.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1650538/104861064.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1650538/104861064.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1650538/104861064.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>EXTERIOR</strong></h3><p>According to the seller, the car was painted Damask Red in 2014 by the previous owner. He considers the paint to be in 'good condition with normal wear and tear,' including 'some paint chips in the front of the vehicle, mostly on the hood.' Exterior photos appear to show a mellow paint finish that retains a nice gloss. All factory-style brightwork and badging appear to be present and in good condition. The seller doesn't 'see any evidence of rust repair,' and photos of the exterior don't show any obvious corrosion. All exterior lighting is said to work, while the glass is described as in 'good condition.'&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1650534/104861164.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1650534/104861164.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1650534/104861164.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1650549/104861144.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1650549/104861144.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1650549/104861144.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>INTERIOR</strong></h3><p>Interior photos seem to show that the car has factory-type black brushed nylon and vinyl seat upholstery. 'There is some wear on the bolster of the driver's seat,' the seller notes. Photos appear to show worn upholstery material, as he describes. The mechanical seat adjustment works 'as intended,' he says, as do the manual windows. The carpet is described as in 'good condition,' and the headliner has 'no tears or sags.' Photos seem to confirm these observations. The car's weather seals are said to be in good condition, and there are 'no water leaks.'&nbsp;</p><p>According to the seller, 'all gauges work and are accurate,' and a modern stereo with AM/FM and Bluetooth/digital capability has been installed and works. The heater is said to be functional. The seller mentions that an aftermarket steering wheel and footwell rugs are fitted, which photos appear to confirm.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1650547/104861259.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1650547/104861259.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1650547/104861259.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1650531/104861256.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1650531/104861256.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1650531/104861256.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>CHASSIS</strong></h3><p>The MGB-GT used an independent front suspension system with lever-arm dampers (shocks) that also doubled as the upper control arms, while a live axle on leaf springs, also with lever-arm shocks, is used in the rear. The seller says he's 'refurbished' the shocks and replaced all the factory 'Metalastic' suspension bushings with polyurethane items. The new bushings give the car a 'good stiff feel,' in the seller's opinion. &nbsp;</p><p>The car's front disc and rear drum brakes are in 'excellent condition,' according to the seller. The front calipers are said to have been rebuilt, while the master cylinder and wheel cylinders were replaced. He says the factory rubber brake lines have been 'replaced with stainless steel.' The brakes have a 'good solid feel and no leaks,' he says. The manual rack-and-pinion steering system is described as in 'good condition' with 'no play when driving.' 'The car drives straight with no vibrations,' he says. &nbsp;</p><p>Exterior photos seem to show that the car is wearing a set of 14-inch Minilite-style aluminum wheels and 185/70R14 Michelin tires. According to the seller, the tires bear DOT date codes from 2017 and have 'a decent amount of tread remaining.'&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1650599/1111.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1650599/1111.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1650599/1111.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1650585/screenshot-2023-05-17-121638.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1650585/screenshot-2023-05-17-121638.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1650585/screenshot-2023-05-17-121638.jpg' /></p>"

The engine bay presents as generally clean.</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1654828/104627189.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1654828/104627189.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1654828/104627189.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1647554/104627248.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1647554/104627248.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1647554/104627248.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>EXTERIOR</strong></h3><p>The Oxford White paint is believed to be original, with the seller rating it at 7 on a scale of 10. The cab seals reportedly 'look good,' with no evidence of water leaks. The seller notes some dings and imperfections, and notes that the F350's driver's-side front fender, headlamp, and front bumper were replaced following a minor accident. The seller states that the truck has 'very minimal surface rust.' The cargo bed shows scuffs and is fitted with a Reese fifth-wheel hitch. The seller notes 'two pebble-sized cracks' in the windshield but no other damage to the glass. All lights are said to work. The underside presents as generally clean, with light surface corrosion visible.</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1647560/104627303.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1647560/104627303.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1647560/104627303.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1647610/104627225.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1647610/104627225.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1647610/104627225.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>INTERIOR</strong></h3><p>The gray cloth seats and related materials are reported to be 'in great shape,' with no tears or other visible damage. The carpet shows no holes or excessive wear. The seller reports that the headliner is beginning to sag but has functional dome lighting. No interior trim or small controls are said to be missing. The padded dashboard shows no damage, and the factory instruments reportedly 'work perfect.' An aftermarket audio head is described as USB-compatible, but the speakers are said to be inoperative. The air conditioning, heater, and power windows are reported to be in good working order. The power lock for the rear passenger door reportedly sticks occasionally.</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1647498/104627241.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1647498/104627241.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1647498/104627241.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1647567/104627236.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1647567/104627236.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1647567/104627236.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>CHASSIS</strong></h3><p>The chassis of this F350 is unmodified and features dual rear wheels.

The power steering is described as leak-free.&nbsp; The seller reports 'no leaks, no cracks' when discussing the shock absorbers and bushings. The power front disc/rear drum antilock brakes are said to 'work perfect.' The seller cites 'minor blemishes' to the polished aluminum wheels. The tires' age is uncertain and the tires' DOT date coding cannot be determined from the photos provided. The rear tires are estimated to be four to five years old, with the age of the front tires estimated at 'a couple of years.'&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1650302/2.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1650302/2.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1650302/2.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1650300/1.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1650300/1.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1650300/1.jpg' /></p>"

			"content": "<p>Situated between the Dodge and Chrysler lines in its parent corporation's model hierarchy, De Soto offered contemporary styling as well as trim, luxury, and performance levels that kept its sticker prices within financial reach of a wide swath of buyers.&nbsp;</p><p>This 1960 DeSoto Adventurer Four-Door Sedan is 'an older restoration' according to the seller. It also retains its original interior, factory A/C, a power seat, and additional options. 'Originally from Arizona, the car's previous owner drove it to New York from South Carolina before I paid for it,' the seller recalls. 'The only issue on that drive was one lost wheel cover.'</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1646325/104626920.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1646325/104626920.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1646325/104626920.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>POWERTRAIN</strong></h3><p>He believes the optional 325-horsepower, 383-cu.in. four-barrel Adventurer Mark I OHV V8 to be original to the car. To that end, he has provided a photo of the block that shows the correct 'P38' engine code for a 1960 383 and the '1105' (November 5th) date code, which is close enough to the car's scheduled production date of '1124' (November 24th) on the body data plate to possibly be the original engine.&nbsp;</p><p>Several years ago, the seller rebuilt the carburetor. He says regarding cold starts, 'I crank the engine a few times to bring gas from the tank to the carb then rest a few seconds. Sometimes I do this twice, or even three times depending on how long the car has been sitting. It idles fast and rich, but will drop the idle as it warms up (see video).'&nbsp;</p><p>Though the engine and differential 'both look wet, they don't drip,' he reports.&nbsp; The TorqueFlite three-speed automatic transmission leaks, 'but I don't know where from,' he admits. 'I replaced the pan gasket and I usually top it off each spring, adding not even a pint, which is good for the season,' the seller assures. 'The transmission shifts beautifully, and it's a joy to experience a TorqueFlite like this one.' A set of 'economy ratio' 2.93:1 gears are in the rear axle.</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1646294/104626973.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1646294/104626973.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1646294/104626973.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1646207/104626830.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1646207/104626830.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1646207/104626830.jpg' /></p><h3>EXTERIOR</h3><p>Originally painted Shell White (code-W) on the roof and a Marine Aqua (code-J) on the body, as shown on the body data plate, the former owner refinished the body in Willow Green (code-F). 'It still shines nicely,' the seller states. There are 'no swirls, but it does have a few nicks, as I have shown in the pictures. This car was Ziebarted when new and was originally shipped to a De Soto dealer in Bisbee, Arizona. Currently, there's only some surface rust on the underside.' &nbsp;</p><p>The optional Solex tinted glass is 'in great shape,' he observes. 'There are no cracks or missing pieces in the seals, but the windowsill whiskers are old.' All of the lights work. 'I glued an 'Objects in mirror are closer than they appear' mirror over the original on the passenger's side, but it can be removed.'&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1646232/104626891.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1646232/104626891.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1646232/104626891.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1646313/104626917.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1646313/104626917.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1646313/104626917.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>INTERIOR</strong></h3><p>Overall, 'the original [black cloth with gray and white vinyl] upholstery is amazing,' the seller says, 'but there is a 3-inch split on the driver's side where the fabric meets the vinyl (see photo). I treated it with a rip-stop liquid to prevent its spreading, but this is not a permanent solution.' Carpet wear is evident on the front passenger's side and the rear driver's side, but 'the driver's footwell still has the original heel pad in good shape.' The headliner is intact, but 'the dome light lens is cracked and fragile,' he adds.</p><p>Functioning properly are the instruments, radio, and the heater/defroster, but 'the A/C does not work, some components are missing from the cruise control [Thru-Way Auto-Pilot], the clock runs intermittently, and the optional rear speaker is not hooked up,' he reveals. Modifications were limited to installing seatbelts and 'a modern brake-light switch to light the lights sooner.'</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1646240/104626958.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1646240/104626958.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1646240/104626958.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1646320/104626959.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1646320/104626959.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1646320/104626959.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>CHASSIS</strong></h3><p>Over the 10-plus years the seller has owned the car he has periodically 'greased the chassis,' so he recommends replacing the suspension bushings, and possibly the shocks. The power-assisted four-wheel drum brakes 'are amazing,' he says, 'and the parking brake holds well, too.'</p><p>The correct wheel covers reveal 'normal wear and tear and three extras are in the trunk,' but the tires should be replaced due to age. 'Inserting new O-rings into the power steering system solved a past leak,' and the system works as designed.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1646305/104626909.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1646305/104626909.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1646305/104626909.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1646241/104626903.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1646241/104626903.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1646241/104626903.jpg' /></p>"

			"content": "<p>This is a rare cat—a 1970 Mercury Cougar XR7 428 Cobra Jet Convertible with Ram Air and a four-speed. Published figures show only 66 XR7 convertibles were built for the year with the 428 CJ engine and only 17 of them, like this one, also were built with the manual transmission. According to the Marti Report, only two of those cars were sprayed Competition Blue and this is the only one with a black leather interior. In addition to the Ram Air induction and four-speed, this rare muscle Mercury was also optioned with a black power top, center console, power front disc brakes, power steering, intermittent wipers, and more. Per the selling dealer, the original owner is unknown, but from August 1979 until this year, the car was in the same family. It reportedly underwent a restoration in 2015 and has seen only about 200 miles since, with the seller noting it remains 'in near #1 condition.'&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1592798/p1230805.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1592798/p1230805.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1592798/p1230805.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>POWERTRAIN</strong></h3><p>A correct Cobra Jet 428-cu.in. OHV V8 powers this XR7, but it is not the original engine, says the seller. The block's casting number and date code are reportedly period correct, and the engine build is said to have included balancing and blueprinting. Enhancements reportedly included hardened valve seats for compatibility with unleaded fuel. Dyno testing showed the engine produced 391 horsepower and 485 lb-ft of torque. The seller notes the engine starts easily and runs well, with no reported smoke and no leaks or weeping. The complementing four-speed close-ratio gearbox is also said to shift smoothly. 'It feels like a 1970 muscle car,' says the seller. Additional drivetrain details include a 3.50-geared rear axle.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1592688/p1230744.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1592688/p1230744.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1592688/p1230744.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1592662/p1230719.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1592662/p1230719.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1592662/p1230719.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>EXTERIOR</strong></h3><p>According to the seller, the 2015 rotisserie-type restoration of this Cougar stripped the body to bare metal before it was repainted its original J-code Competition Blue. It was reportedly finished to a concours-level quality and is said to remain in show-ready condition, with no swirl marks or blemishes in the paintwork. The seller also asserts the body is 'rust-free' and that the black, power-operated top looks and works 'as new,' with a tight, leak-free fit. Similarly, the correct date-coded glass is reportedly in 'excellent' condition and all the body seals and other rubber were replaced during the restoration and remain in 'excellent' condition. All the exterior lighting reportedly works normally, too, including the vacuum-operated headlamp doors and sequential taillights.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1592697/p1230752.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1592697/p1230752.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1592697/p1230752.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1592734/p1230785.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1592734/p1230785.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1592734/p1230785.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>INTERIOR</strong></h3><p>The one-of-one black leather interior on this Cobra Jet Cougar has also been restored and still appears fresh, with only about 200 miles on the car since the resto was completed. The upholstery and carpet were replaced during the project and remain in new-appearing condition, according to the seller, with virtually no wear. Likewise, the door panels, center console, and dash pad also appear in very good condition, along with steering wheel. The woodgrain-appearing finish on the steering wheel, console, and gauge panel insert also looks very good and the seller reports all the interior trim is intact. Additionally, the heater and factory AM radio are said to be functional.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1592838/p1230844.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1592838/p1230844.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1592838/p1230844.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1592849/p1230854.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1592849/p1230854.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1592849/p1230854.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>CHASSIS</strong></h3><p>According to the seller, the chassis, suspension, and brakes have been restored to stock specifications and all are in good order, with no noted needs or issues. 'The steering is firm and has a good on-center feel,' says the seller, who adds the brakes have a 'great pedal feel.' The suspension system has reportedly been inspected and shown to be in good condition. Additionally, the car rolls on reproduction Goodyear Polyglas F70-14 bias-ply tires, mounted on the stock-style steel wheels with trim rings. All were installed during the restoration in 2015 and are said to remain in 'like new' condition, with virtually no wear on the tires or blemishes on the wheels.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1627580/screenshot-2023-05-09-113145.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1627580/screenshot-2023-05-09-113145.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1627580/screenshot-2023-05-09-113145.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1592717/p1230769.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1592717/p1230769.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1592717/p1230769.jpg' /></p>"

V8, according to the seller. It's not known whether it's the car's original engine, but the performance upgrades include a high-lift camshaft, 351W heads with high-performance valvetrain components, and two 500-cfm Carter AFB carburetors mounted on an aluminum intake manifold. There's also a set of tuned headers and a dual-exhaust system with Flowmaster mufflers, according to the seller, who adds the engine is rated at approximately 375 horsepower. It is said to 'start easy' and run well, with no smoke. The seller also adds the engine is paired with a modern T-5 five-speed overdrive manual gearbox that transfers torque to a 3.91-geared 9-inch rear axle that's also equipped with Detroit Locker limited-slip differential. The only leak noted with the powertrain is beneath the rear axle.</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1165683/91247792.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1165683/91247792.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1165683/91247792.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1165673/91247756.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1165673/91247756.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1165673/91247756.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>EXTERIOR</strong></h3><p>The exterior was resprayed blue a few years ago. 'Much money was spent on the paint job and it shows,' says the seller, who notes 'there are the odd scratches, paint chips and little imperfections, but they're not very noticeable.' As for rust, the body is said to have been well maintained over the years. 'There are a couple of small bubbles and tiny surfaces spots where the paint has chipped, but they're small and isolated,' says the seller. Exterior modifications include Shelby-style rear taillights, a GT grille with fog lamps, a hood scoop, rear side scoops, and mild rear fender flares. All the glass is said to be in great shape, with no reported cracks or chips, and the seller says the seals seem fine, but the trunk seal may need to be replaced, as a litter water intrusion occurs under high-pressure washing.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1165659/91248054.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1165659/91248054.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1165659/91248054.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1165653/91248011.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1165653/91248011.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1165653/91248011.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>INTERIOR</strong></h3><p>This Mustang's black vinyl cabin appears in very good condition and features a number of modifications and upgrades, starting with the high-back bucket seats and collapsible steering column from a 1969 Mustang. The seat covers appear in very good condition and the seller reports the carpet was replaced in 2021. The seller notes the headliner does not sag but has a small hole in it. The door panels, dash pad, and aftermarket steering wheel also appear in very good condition, while all the interior panels have reportedly been refurbished. Additional cabin upgrades include a Shelby-style roll bar, several aftermarket gauges, and LED lighting added to the instrument panel, front floor lights, and rear dome lamps. There's also an older replacement cassette head unit in place of the original radio. It is said to work well through a pair of in-dash speakers. A power amp and a pair of 6x9-inch speakers (not installed) are included.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1165680/91248136.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1165680/91248136.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1165680/91248136.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1165679/91248126.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1165679/91248126.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1165679/91248126.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>CHASSIS</strong></h3><p>According to the seller, the chassis, suspension, and brake elements are good order, with no known needs or issues. The only known deviations from the stock specs are rear air shocks and heavy-duty front and rear stabilizer bars. Additionally, the car has manual steering and manual front disc, rear drum brakes. There is no play in the steering system, notes the seller, and no reported vibrations with highway driving. The car rolls on Hercules radial tires mounted on vintage 15-inch five-slot aluminum wheels. 'The tires are only a couple of years old, but have hardly any miles on them,' says the seller. The wheels are also reported to be in great shape.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1165650/91248124.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1165650/91248124.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1165650/91248124.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1165677/Pic48.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1165677/Pic48.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1165677/Pic48.jpg' /></p>"

It's a Kentucky-based car the seller says was used primarily for car shows by her deceased husband and has always been garaged.

			"content": "<p>Born of the desire to win in SCCA Trans-Am competition, the 1969 Ford Mustang Boss 302 had to also be offered for public sale in sufficient numbers to meet homologation requirements. This example was restored by its prior owner, and was treated to a few engine upgrades, as well as an electric power steering conversion. According to the seller, who purchased the car in 2015, 'The previous owner had it for at least 30 years in Florida, and he had been part of the Boss Mustang community.'</p><p>Two invoices and a Marti Report are included in the sale. Per the seller, the first invoice was sourced by the previous owner from Lois Eminger in 1985 (see photo), and it came with a letter (see photo). That invoice lists the Boss 302's exterior color as Bright Yellow (code-9) and its interior as black (trim 2A), which matches the car's buck tag (see photo), and the door-mounted warranty plate (but that may be a reproduction).</p><p>The seller ordered a Marti Report, but it stated that the car was Wimbledon White with blue interior, not Bright Yellow with black interior. He then obtained the invoice from Marti Auto Works, and it has the same VIN and equipment as the invoice provided 1985, but the body color and the dealers are different. It appears that the car was invoiced a second time to be sent to another dealer, and during that process the exterior and interior colors were inadvertently changed on the paperwork. Nevertheless, based on the original invoice, the restoration photos he was given, and his own experience of disassembling and reassembling many areas of the Mustang in 2017 to detail them, the seller is confident that this Boss 302 has always been Bright Yellow with black interior.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1680686/img-6119.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1680686/img-6119.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1680686/img-6119.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>POWERTRAIN</strong></h3><p>He is quick to note that the high-performance 302-cu.in. four-barrel OHV V8 (code-G in the VIN) currently between the shock towers is not the original. 'The block and heads are service replacements,' he says. 'This engine was last rebuilt before my ownership, and I don't know the exact date.' Its smog equipment, intake manifold, and rocker covers are reported to be correct for 1969, as is the distributor, but it has been updated to electronic operation from dual-point. And the Holley carburetor is a 'reissue for the 1970 Boss 302.'&nbsp;</p><p>Additional modifications include a more aggressive camshaft, FPA custom headers, and Flowmaster mufflers. However, 'The difficult-to-find original exhaust manifolds, heat riser, and full factory exhaust system are also included in the sale,' he confirms.&nbsp;</p><p>For cold starts, 'pull the factory manual choke under the dash and start the engine,' the seller advises. 'When it's warm, release the choke, and it runs great.' There is 'no smoke, but there are small leaks below the transmission and rear axle.' The four-speed Toploader 'shifts well through all the gears,' and power is delivered to a 3.50:1-geared Traction Lok rear axle.</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1680652/img-5942.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1680652/img-5942.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1680652/img-5942.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1680659/img-5968.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1680659/img-5968.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1680659/img-5968.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>EXTERIOR</strong></h3><p>The Mustang was repainted Bright Yellow during its restoration, and the finish is still 'very good, with no swirls' the seller says, but there are 'a few chips and a few scratches in the semi-gloss black.' Both quarter panels were previously replaced, and there is 'no rust' on the body. The glass is 'good with just light scratches, and the door seals, felt strips, and trunk seals are like new.' All of the exterior lighting works.</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1680673/img-5894.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1680673/img-5894.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1680673/img-5894.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1680672/img-5893.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1680672/img-5893.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1680672/img-5893.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>INTERIOR</strong></h3><p>Inside, the black vinyl upholstery is of 'good quality,' the seller says, and extender tracks for the driver's seat have increased its range of motion to also 'accommodate taller drivers.' Both the carpet and headliner rate 'good,' and the trim is complete.</p><p>The stock gauges, aftermarket tachometer, and heat operate as designed. Updates include a smaller-diameter aftermarket steering wheel, a modern stereo that retains a vintage appearance, and the aforementioned underdash-but-not-visible electric power steering. He notes that 'the original steering wheel and column are included in the sale.'</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1680455/img-6217.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1680455/img-6217.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1680455/img-6217.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1680242/img-6207.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1680242/img-6207.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1680242/img-6207.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>CHASSIS</strong></h3><p>In 2019, new bushings and KYB gas shocks were installed and the suspension was lubed, according to the seller. 'No issues' exist with the power front disc/rear drum brakes, 'the pedal is firm and high, and stopping distances are good.' The 15-inch Magnum 500 steel wheels are fine, and the tires 'are approximately eight years old.' There is 'no steering play, the car tracks straight, and it rides nicely.'</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1681569/boss-vin-car.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1681569/boss-vin-car.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1681569/boss-vin-car.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1680696/screenshot-2023-05-26-124715.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1680696/screenshot-2023-05-26-124715.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1680696/screenshot-2023-05-26-124715.jpg' /></p>"

The seller has owned it for more than 20 years, and the work had been completed prior to him purchasing it. Yet it still presents quite well.</p><p>'I searched specifically for a '67 convertible that was already restored,' the seller explains. 'I came across this vehicle in northern Ohio in 2002. Neither the seller nor previous owner could provide any details about the car or restoration work, but I've since installed more correct parts and made some improvements. I primarily use this car for shows, cruise-ins, and parades.' He goes on to say, 'It's been treated very gently over the years and is still in fantastic condition.'&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1670277/20230520-135834.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1670277/20230520-135834.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1670277/20230520-135834.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>POWERTRAIN</strong></h3><p>'The engine is original,' the seller notes, and he has a photo and PHS documents to confirm it. Engine code 'YS' (see photo) is correct for the powertrain, and the engine unit number '570331' that's listed above that code matches the one on the car's invoice, which is included in the PHS docs. It verifies this 400-cu.in. OHV V8 as the one that was originally factory installed. Rated at 335 horsepower and 441 lb-ft of torque, this standard GTO engine retains the 'correct 670 heads, and runs very well,' according to the seller. He has 'some receipts that indicate the engine was rebuilt in 1985, but I can only attest to the 8,000 miles I put on it since owning it.'</p><p>He discloses, 'It cranks longer on cold start, and I pump the gas pedal twice every 5-6 seconds until it starts. White smoke comes out of both exhaust pipes for a few minutes until the engine warms up, and the rear main seal drips oil.' The water pump was replaced several years ago, and an electronic ignition upgrade was done. He has also installed a period-correct Quadrajet carburetor, and has recently replaced the fuel pump, fuel lines, and gas tank.</p><p>The three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic automatic transmission 'shifts smoothly through all gears in both 'His' and 'Hers' mode, and gaskets were just replaced to resolve a pan leak,' he says. A 3.36:1 gearset is in the differential. The seller states that the differential carries code E047, which he says is 'one day from engine block date code.'&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1670240/20230520-135538.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1670240/20230520-135538.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1670240/20230520-135538.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1670253/20230520-135644.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1670253/20230520-135644.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1670253/20230520-135644.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>EXTERIOR</strong></h3><p>Though there's 'no documentation as to when the restoration work was done,' he believes that 'the GTO was repainted in its factory color of Fathom Blue [code-E] most likely in the mid-to-late 1980s.' He adds, 'The finish, bright trim, and chrome are in very good shape, but there are chips along the driver's door edge, and the rear deck was touched-up, which is visible upon close examination. Paint thickness measurements were made in the rust-prone areas with no evidence of body filler revealed,' the seller reports. 'There's some surface rust on the trunk floor under the mat, but the floor is solid.'</p><p>The white power convertible top is 'in perfect condition and functions properly.' It hasn't been leak-checked because the seller 'doesn't let the car get wet.'

			"content": "<p>Considered the holy grail of muscle cars by scores of Mopar fans, the 1970 Plymouth Hemi 'Cuda embodied an elevated level of design and engineering prowess that the automaker possessed at the time. This new E-body's look was contemporary and its power legendary.&nbsp;</p><p>What's more, a popular color like B5 Blue Fire Metallic, and the addition of a Pistol-Grip-shifted four-speed and the Super Track Pak's power front disc brakes and 9.75-inch rear axle stuffed with 4.10:1 gears and a Sure-Grip, could make it even better, as they have in this 1970 Plymouth Hemi 'Cuda.&nbsp;</p><p>The seller states, 'I've had the car for 18 years. It was brought to me for a restoration, and in the middle of the process, the former owner decided that he couldn't wait for it to be finished, so I bought it from him. It was completed in 2013, and the Plymouth has been driven about 370 miles in the past 18 years.'

He adds that 'the block was restamped' (see photo) before he got the Plymouth. The 'Cuda was built with a TorqueFlite automatic, per its fender tag, and it has since been swapped for the four-speed gearbox.&nbsp;</p><p>Under the Shaker hood scoop, the 425-horsepower, 426-cu.in.

Modifications were limited to a mandrel-bent, 2.5-inch pipe diameter exhaust system with performance mufflers and electronic ignition. 'Pump the gas pedal and turn the key to start it,' he advises. The Hemi has a 'good cold idle, there's no smoke, and it runs great. A drop or two of oil can appear under the engine over long periods, and there are small weeps around the differential,' he adds.

Power is sent to the rear wheels via a five-speed manual transmission which has 'no issues,' according to the seller. &nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1612337/img-1306.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1612337/img-1306.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1612337/img-1306.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1612311/img-1298.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1612311/img-1298.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1612311/img-1298.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>EXTERIOR</strong></h3><p>This Triumph was repainted in 2002, according to the seller. He says the paint is 'nice, but not perfect.' In photos, it appears the car is finished in Poseidon Green Metalic, and that factory-style decals are present. The seller mentions that there was a 'small spot [of rust] on [the] rocker panel, the size of a quarter' that was repaired when the car was repainted. Photos don't appear to show any obvious signs of corrosion.&nbsp;</p><p>The seller notes that the black convertible top was installed in 2003 but has suffered some 'mice damage' near the rear window. Photos appear to confirm his statement. He says that the convertible top 'does not leak.'&nbsp; He also mentions that the car's glass has 'minor scratches.'</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1581456/99064529.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1581456/99064529.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1581456/99064529.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1589397/img-1232.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1589397/img-1232.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1589397/img-1232.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>INTERIOR</strong></h3><p>The tan vinyl seats adjust and recline correctly and show no tears, according to the seller, who notes that they were 'replaced in 2003' along with matching carpet. He mentions that there is damage 'where a mouse chewed on [the] passenger's floormat.' Interior photos seem to show some minor wear items, such as slight splitting to the armrests and a cracked door handle bezel.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the seller, the non-power door locks and window mechanisms work and all the gauges and interior lighting work, as does the heater. The odometer was replaced, and the seller estimates the actual total mileage on the car to be 59,132 miles. The car was equipped with air conditioning, but it is non-functional, notes the seller. An aftermarket stereo is fitted and is said to work. &nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1589410/img-1239.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1589410/img-1239.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1589410/img-1239.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1581451/99064657.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1581451/99064657.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1581451/99064657.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>CHASSIS</strong></h3><p>According to the seller, this TR8's suspension was rebuilt with new shocks, struts, and springs in 2003. The bushings are in 'good condition,' he says. He also states that new brake pads, brake shoes, and wheel cylinders were installed at that time. The brakes remain in 'good condition,' according to the seller. He says the power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering has 'a small leak at [the] rack' but that the Triumph 'drives straight with no play.' Underbody photos don't appear to show any corrosion to chassis components or body panels.&nbsp;</p><p>The seller installed aftermarket 15-inch American Racing alloy wheels, which he describes as being in 'fair condition.' He notes that he has the original wheels. Photos appear to show that the car is equipped with 195/50R15 Fuzion ZR1 tires.

			"content": "<p>An absolute revelation when it was introduced in 1989, Mazda's Miata is credited with singlehandedly resurrecting the small two-seat roadster segment. Before the Miata, this sector of the automotive marketplace was dominated by European sports cars. Absolutely delightful automobiles when they ran, American motorists ultimately came to discover reliability wasn't exactly their long suit. With the introduction of the 1989 Miata, Mazda brought back everything people had loved about those small European roadsters, with their dependability issues left by the wayside. This 2016 Mazda MX-5 Miata Sport Convertible, offered for sale by a dealer in Oklahoma City, features a manual transmission and premium OZ aftermarket wheels and comes from the first year of the car's fourth generation.</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86='' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1571677/img-4921.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1571677/img-4921.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1571677/img-4921.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>POWERTRAIN</strong></h3><p>The 2016 Mazda Miata is powered by a 155-horsepower, 2.0-liter DOHC inline-four that produces 148 lb-ft of torque. This 44,000-mile example is fitted with a six-speed manual transmission, which feeds power to the rear wheels. The seller represents the engine and transmission as being in 'great condition,' saying the transmission 'shifts beautifully, with no clunks or thumps.' The engine is said to be the original power unit, with no modifications, nor has it been rebuilt. The seller reports no issues with cold starts and says there are no leaks or weeps to report.</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1581937/img-4877.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1581937/img-4877.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1581937/img-4877.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1581936/img-4886.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1581936/img-4886.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1581936/img-4886.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>EXTERIOR</strong></h3><p>Model year 2016 also marked a significant departure for the Miata in terms of its styling. Auto reviewers, thoroughly smitten with the car's new look, gushed, 'This is the first time the Miata looks sexy!' Finished in Mazda's Crystal White paint with a black canvas roof, the seller says this car's paint is all-original, with no blemishes, dents, or paint chips. Represented as a 'rust-free' car, the seller also says there are no body modifications. The roof is said to work as it should, with no leaks or damage. All glass is stated to be in 'excellent' condition, with no scratches or cracks. Similarly, all lights are said to work as intended. Moreover, all of the car's seals are said to be waterproof and undamaged.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1571669/img-4909.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1571669/img-4909.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1571669/img-4909.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1571666/img-4912.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1571666/img-4912.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1571666/img-4912.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>INTERIOR</strong></h3><p>This example has Mazda's black cloth upholstery, a grippy fabric that helps hold occupants in place when the car's agility is being enjoyed.

Power windows and door locks are reported to be working as intended as well. The heat and A/C systems are also stated to be functional. The factory shift knob has been replaced with an aftermarket one, said by the seller to be the hilt from a katana sword.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1569638/3.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1569638/3.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1569638/3.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=''data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1569632/4.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1569632/4.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1569632/4.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>CHASSIS</strong></h3><p>This example is posited as driving straight, with no play in the steering wheel. The aftermarket OZ wheels are represented as being straight, with no curb rash, pitting, or vibrations. This version of the Miata uses electric power steering, so there is no fluid to leak.

However, the seller says, 'We don't use it anymore,' so it's being placed on the market in the hopes of finding its next custodian. &nbsp;</p><p>Morgan cars have been handbuilt in England for over a century. The firm's Plus 4 model was launched at the 1950 British International Motor Show held at Earl's Court.&nbsp;<em>Motor Sport&nbsp;</em>said at the time: 'Do not miss the new Plus 4 model. It should be exciting!' Morgan's resolutely traditional cars have long found favor with enthusiasts, racers, and collectors the world over.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1663838/111057178.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1663838/111057178.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1663838/111057178.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>POWERTRAIN</strong></h3><p>This Morgan is powered by a 2.1-liter OHV inline-four, which the factory sourced from Triumph. With twin Zenith-Stromberg carburetors, the cast-iron powerplant was rated at 105 horsepower and 128 lb-ft of torque when new. The seller says, 'The engine was rebuilt 10 years ago, and functions just as intended.' He adds, 'Use [the] manual choke for cold start[ing]' and it 'idles smoothly after start[ing] and does not smoke whatsoever. The engine has a small oil leak, but it is very slight.'&nbsp;</p><p>According to the seller, the car's four-speed manual transmission 'shifts smoothly, with a small&nbsp;<em>snick</em>&nbsp;when going from 1st to 2nd gear when it is cold.' The transmission 'does not leak,' he says. &nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1663825/111055389.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1663825/111055389.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1663825/111055389.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1663826/111055411.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1663826/111055411.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1663826/111055411.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>EXTERIOR</strong></h3><p>The 'vehicle was repainted approximately eight years ago and is in mint shape,' and there are 'no swirls,' says the seller. Photos appear to show that the burgundy body and black wings (fenders) wear lustrous, glossy paint matching the seller's description. There are 'no scratches [or] dents,' he says, save for 'one very small paint chip on the driver's door hinge.' He further elaborates, mentioning there have been 'no recent rust repairs' and that there's 'no visible rust.' The exterior photos don't appear to show any corrosion. The car's windshield is 'perfect,' but the side curtains are 'slightly cloudy,' though they're said to 'work perfectly.' The vinyl convertible top's windows are 'discolored,' according to the seller. Photos appear to confirm his observation. The top remains 'functional,' and the vehicle 'does not leak,' he says. All lighting is said to 'work as intended.'&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1663789/111056585.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1663789/111056585.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1663789/111056585.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1663800/111056604.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1663800/111056604.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1663800/111056604.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>INTERIOR</strong></h3><p>The tan leather seats are described as 'perfect,' having been 'redone five years ago.' The tonneau cover is said to have been replaced at the same time. It has 'no leaks,' according to the seller. Photos of the car's interior appear to show seats and soft trim that's free from tears or excessive wear. 'The floorboard area is in very good condition,' says the seller, and there's 'no trim missing,' while 'all knobs and switches are vintage OEM.' They're in 'very good condition,' he says. The gauges are described as being in working order though the 'water temp gauge in the [the] original cluster does not function. A secondary water temp gauge has been installed and works as intended.' Photos appear to show an aftermarket water temperature gauge installed under the dashboard. The walnut dashboard appears to be in good condition, based on photos. The heater is not in working order, according to the seller.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1663851/111057264.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1663851/111057264.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1663851/111057264.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1663841/111057328.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1663841/111057328.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1663841/111057328.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>CHASSIS</strong></h3><p>The Plus 4 chassis frame is constructed of Z-section steel rails. An ash body frame is erected on the chassis and then clothed in steel panels. The chassis frame is underslung beneath a live rear axle suspended on leaf springs, while Morgan's traditional coil-sprung sliding pillar suspension system is used in front. Suspension movement is controlled by tube shocks in front and lever-arm dampers aft. According to the seller, the car's suspension bushings and shocks are in 'good to very good' condition with 'no leaks from the differential or axle.' Underbody photos seem to show evidence of minor surface corrosion to the chassis and suspension components. The front disc and rear drum brakes have been 'inspected and tested,' with one wheel cylinder being replaced with a 'genuine Morgan OEM part.' The seller says that the manual cam-and-peg steering box is 'tight, with no play whatsoever,' and the car 'tracks smoothly with no wandering.' The handling is described as 'very solid.'&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Photos indicate that this Plus 4 has a full set of five factory-style 15-inch steel wire wheels. According to the seller, the wheels have 'no curb rash or vibration at highway speed,' though 'two of the wheels have some pitting.' The road wheels appear to be fitted with Kelly Springfield 5.60-15 tires, while the rear-mounted spare wheel appears to wear a Dunlop tire of the same size. DOT date codes visible in photos of the road wheels indicate a 1998 year of manufacture.&nbsp;</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1663846/111056917.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1663846/111056917.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1663846/111056917.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1663890/111057416.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1663890/111057416.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1663890/111057416.jpg' /></p>"

The car appears a little rough around the edges in photos, though the issues appear to be cosmetic in nature. The Ford V8, which the seller believes is original, is said to start and run well. The seller says the 92,000 miles shown are not accurate, explaining that the speedometer and odometer did not work when he bought it, and were not working for the previous owner, either.</p><p>The Sunbeam Tiger came about when the British automaker contracted with Carroll Shelby to develop a V8-powered version of its Alpine sports car, like what Shelby had done to transform the British AC Ace into the Cobra. Shelby's Southern California operation built the prototype, engineering a steering swap and other modifications to fit the 260-cu.in. (4.2-liter) Ford Fairlane V8. The car was named Tiger, and production was handled in England by Jensen.

The owner says his Tiger's engine 'appears original,' and it 'starts and runs every time with no smoke or knocks.' He reports a rattle at startup that quiets down when the engine is warm. He indicates that the ignition module and water pump were replaced in 2019, along with a re-cored radiator. The remote oil filter was removed, and the fuel pump was replaced at some point, he states. The original parts will be included with the sale. (See photos.)</p><p>'When starting, let it crank some to build oil pressure, then pump the gas several times. It holds good oil pressure when hot,' he says. 'Some drips' are reported for the rear main seal and the differential. The four-speed manual transmission is said to 'shift as it should.'</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1692704/img-20230520-184928505-burst000-cover.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1692704/img-20230520-184928505-burst000-cover.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1692704/img-20230520-184928505-burst000-cover.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1692679/img-20230520-185033160-burst000-cover.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1692679/img-20230520-185033160-burst000-cover.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1692679/img-20230520-185033160-burst000-cover.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>EXTERIOR</strong></h3><p>The seller states that the Tiger has a 'very old' repaint in blue with 'lots of scratches and dings,' and the driver's rear wheel arch has 'minor damage' on the lip. Louvers were added to the original hood. He says rust filler was used before the repaint and 'no rust is showing.' Significant paint damage on the right-rear quarter panel was caused by gasoline spilling from the filler. The convertible top is said to be complete and functional, with two small holes and a 'good' plastic rear window. The top's frame attachment on the driver's side is missing a screw. The windshield and door glass are in 'good condition,' but the passenger window glass is detached from the regulator. 'The window can be raised by hand, and then you crank up the regulator,' the seller says. 'The seals are 55 years old and leak.' All lighting functions as designed, he states.</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1692693/119603627.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1692693/119603627.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1692693/119603627.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1692708/119588285.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1692708/119588285.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1692708/119588285.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>INTERIOR</strong></h3><p>According to the owner, the car's carpet is in 'fair condition,' and he reports the hood release knob is broken. Photos show that the original steering wheel is 'worn and torn.' The black vinyl seats are in 'good condition,' but the upholstery isn't original to the car, and seat adjustments function as designed. The seller says the heat works, but the heater control valve is not original, and hot and cold settings are opposite on the control panel. As noted, the speedometer and odometer do not work. The temperature gauge is a parts-store replacement, but the sale will include the original Jaeger gauge. Another modification was the installation of three-point seatbelts.</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1703991/img-20230602-175324109-burst000-cover.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1703991/img-20230602-175324109-burst000-cover.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1703991/img-20230602-175324109-burst000-cover.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1704047/img-20230602-180013131-burst000-cover.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1704047/img-20230602-180013131-burst000-cover.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1704047/img-20230602-180013131-burst000-cover.jpg' /></p><h3><strong>CHASSIS</strong></h3><p>The seller reports that the Tiger's front suspension was rebuilt by the previous owner, and new rear leaf springs were installed in 2010. The Koni shocks appear to be in 'good condition,' he states. The 13-inch American Racing slotted-aluminum wheels are in 'good condition,' per the seller, but he has only one center cap. The seller indicates new 185/70R13 Laufenn S Fit all-season tires, which show 2021 DOT date codes in the provided photos. The unassisted steering has 'no play,' according to the seller, and the front disc/rear drum brakes were last serviced in 2010, getting rotors, shoes, and pads. He reports replacing the original brake booster was replaced with one from a Sunbeam Alpine Mark IV, a common upgrade performed by a previous owner.</p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1692687/img-20230526-173519007.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1692687/img-20230526-173519007.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1692687/img-20230526-173519007.jpg' /></p><p><img data-v-0500ff86=' data-src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1692707/img-20230525-172631122-burst000-cover.jpg' alt='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/1692707/img-20230525-172631122-burst000-cover.jpg' lazy='loaded' src='https://thumbor-production-auction.hemmings.com/830x0/1692707/img-20230525-172631122-burst000-cover.jpg' /></p>"
